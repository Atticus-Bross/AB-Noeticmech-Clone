! Consider the lightning-fast transformation of Twitter, where six months ago journalists from national newspapers were trading barbs with politicians and experts, and today CEO Elon Musk [changes the site’s rules on a whim](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/04/elon-musk-twitter-algorithm-code-public/673642/), often making it impossible to know who is a legitimate source and who is an impostor. One way is to rebuild trust in institutions by creating a stable, democratic public sphere where open communication is possible. Hon and many others have found a solution in Mastodon, a [nonprofit](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/08/mastodon-now-a-non-profit-organisation/) microblogging platform that’s part of a decentralized social network known as the “[Fediverse](https://the-federation.info/).” In the Fediverse, there is no single company setting the rules, no eccentric CEO, and no algorithmic controls on what users see. For decades, a certain set of digital idealists has [pushed to decentralize power on the internet](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/internet-archive-decentralized-web-web3-brewster-kahle/671647/), to reshape the web in a way that more closely aligns with the vision set by its early architects, before corporations such as Google, Amazon, and Meta controlled so many aspects of life online. [Critics complain](https://www.fastcompany.com/90808984/using-mastodon-is-way-too-complicated-to-ever-topple-twitter) about how technical the Fediverse is, and [can’t figure out how to use a system](https://www.cnet.com/news/social-media/i-want-to-like-mastodon-the-decentralized-network-isnt-making-that-easy/) where they aren’t locked into a centrally controlled timeline. [](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/q9GkyjUK3wHO--YxElERJ9Qcbvw=/0x0:329x500/79x120/media/img/book_reviews/2023/05/12/41w9ilmdlLL._SL500_/original.jpg)](https://web.tertulia.com/book/9780674185043?affiliate=atl-347)  It’s a disagreement that continues to this day, but the debate over centralization has spread beyond politics into a disagreement over the management of our public sphere. Still, Mastodon remains the biggest. Eventually, I’ll be able to see my teen nephew’s Tumblr memes from my Mastodon dashboard. Mastodon’s moderation system is more mature. I’m not going to start every other sentence with \[‘content warning’\] just to make y’all feel better.”  No server on Mastodon is required to follow Rochko’s informal covenant. This is radical decentralization in a nutshell. There are some suggested rules for all servers to follow, but server rights reign supreme. In a sense, platforms such as Mastodon and Bluesky are taking us back to the late-20th-century days of the web, before Google ruled search and Facebook ruled social. No one was sure what structures would take root, because the web simply hadn’t existed long enough to establish a pattern. Even Bluesky CEO Jay Graber [has been coy](https://www.theverge.com/23686778/bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-interview-decentralized-social-media-twitter-mastodon) about what her company’s business model might be. Still, the lure of a decentralized network is strong. Meanwhile, Bluesky is currently the only server available to people using the AT Protocol, which means it will grow without competition for the foreseeable future. I asked the ActivityPub co-creator Evan Prodromou, effectively one of the framers of the Fediverse, how we can prevent a wealthy company from setting up the Mastodon equivalent of Gmail—a server so large that it would re-centralize the Fediverse. Hon said he dreams of using money from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act for Fediverse projects, because they are providing infrastructure for civic communication. These are a lot of hopes and dreams to pile onto a social-networking system that’s still only a few million users strong. Annalee Flower Horne, a founder of the Wandering.shop Mastodon server, told me: “We look at communities and say that if they end, then they’ve failed.
