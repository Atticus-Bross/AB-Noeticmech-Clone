# summarize

Summarize a document using extractive text summarization via tf-idf.

This is a project for DS-1043 at the University of Tulsa. The program,
once completed, is designed to act as a ``filter'' in a pipeline of
commandline utilities. The default behavior is to read data from
standard input and write data to standard output. Data can optionally
be read from a file and/or written to a file.

```
Usage:
  summarize.py [-o <file> | --output=<file>] [<input-file>]
  summarize.py (-h | --help)

Options:
  -h --help            Show this screen.
  -o --output=<file>   Write output to file instead of stdout.
```
